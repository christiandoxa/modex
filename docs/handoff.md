# Current work

The destination repository began empty. The frozen tag and official Linux
release checksum have been verified. Reference source and the oracle are kept
outside the Modex source and build graph, under `~/.cache/modex/`.

The current bootstrap implements product version output. It passes isolated
official-release differential checks with the narrow documented identity
mapping. A clean filesystem/network namespace contains only Modex and the
platform/official Mojo runtime libraries; version output works without Python,
Node, Rust, or Prodex. Native JSON decoding and development `session list` /
`session current` machine-output paths are connected to the production binary.
The inventory contains 60 coarse contracts and 360
platform obligations; 1 Linux obligation passes, and 0 complete cross-platform
contracts pass. Inventory expansion remains necessary; no parity percentage is
valid.

Validation: `make test` (3 Mojo unit programs, a test-only JSON driver, and 16
Python black-box/runtime tests PASS, including 500 deterministic generated
JSON values plus malformed UTF-8/syntax/boundary vectors and numeric/local
session time comparisons across five TZ settings),
`python3 tests/probe_capabilities.py` (3 positive programs PASS,
4 expected public-API gaps reproduced). `python3 tests/session_mismatches.py`
retains 3 FAIL cases and one unapproved safe difference for a baseline panic.
Actual compiler diagnostics and commands are in `docs/evidence/capabilities/`.

The frozen help inventory now contains 35 routes and 326 option mentions,
including four hidden commands and both Super exposure/short aliases. Capture
command: `python3 tests/capture_cli.py`; all help routes exit 0 with empty stderr
and no state mutations. Help mentions still require source validation for
registered flags, hidden flags, defaults, precedence and passthrough.

The active release staging/smoke path imports the JavaScript gateway SDK.
Its module-import compatibility is BLOCKED by the Mojo-only/no-adapter policy,
not removed from scope. `docs/packaging-audit.json` preserves conflicting
source/publishing/README evidence.

Next work: trace hidden/default/precedence flag contracts, close argument and
text-rendering gaps, and evaluate official stdlib mechanisms for lock/recovery
and protected file handling. Current stateful, compressed, leap-second and
future recurring-timezone paths fail explicitly. Startup effects still differ. Details and the baseline
panic are in `docs/known-gaps.md`; no session contract is PASS.

Mojo's public process API has no stdio-redirection, process-group, or
environment-isolation options. Its networking package currently exposes only
internal building blocks. The official stdlib source at the pinned release
must be checked before interpreting missing public APIs as impossible native
implementations. No dependency exception has been introduced.

Native Windows and Intel macOS are not supported by the pinned compiler's
documented platform contract. Linux glibc and CPU minimums are stricter than
the baseline release. These obligations remain in scope as platform gaps.
