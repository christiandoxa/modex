# Current work

The destination repository began empty. The frozen tag and official Linux
release checksum have been verified. Reference source and the oracle are kept
outside the Modex source and build graph, under `~/.cache/modex/`.

The current bootstrap implements product version output, including ignored
trailing arguments after exact leading `--version` and `-V` flags. Twelve
isolated official-release cases pass with no state mutations and the narrow
documented identity mapping. Evidence: `docs/evidence/version-arguments-tests.txt`.
A clean filesystem/network namespace contains only Modex and the
platform/official Mojo runtime libraries; version output works without Python,
Node, Rust, or Prodex. Native JSON decoding and development `session list` /
`session current` machine-output paths are connected to the production binary.
The inventory contains 60 coarse contracts and 360
platform obligations; 1 Linux obligation passes, and 0 complete cross-platform
contracts pass. Inventory expansion remains necessary; no parity percentage is
valid.

Validation: `make test` (4 Mojo unit programs, test-only JSON/Zstandard drivers, and 45
Python black-box/runtime tests PASS, including 500 deterministic generated
JSON values plus malformed UTF-8/syntax/boundary vectors and numeric/local
session time comparisons, including future recurring rules through 2100,
transition-second boundaries, and explicit/invalid POSIX TZ strings),
`python3 tests/probe_capabilities.py` (3 positive programs PASS,
4 expected public-API gaps reproduced). `python3 tests/session_mismatches.py`
retains 3 FAIL cases and one unapproved safe difference for a baseline panic.
Actual compiler diagnostics and commands are in `docs/evidence/capabilities/`.

The frozen help inventory now contains 35 routes and 326 option mentions,
including four hidden commands and both Super exposure/short aliases. Capture
command: `python3 tests/capture_cli.py`; all help routes exit 0 with empty stderr
and no state mutations. Help mentions still require source validation for
registered flags, hidden flags, defaults, precedence and passthrough.

Session help and argument diagnostics now match 271 captured official-release
cases and 152 seeded generated comparisons. Coverage includes suggestions,
short-flag clusters, literal `--` boundaries, nested/root help routing,
ordered multi-flag conflicts, missing/duplicate/value-error precedence,
stdout/stderr and exit codes. Captured help/error paths also check that no
paths are created. Valid-command startup mutations remain outside the output
claims. Suggestion scoring follows the frozen clap_builder 4.6.7/strsim 0.11.1
Jaro behavior, implemented independently in Mojo. Parsing preserves a raw cwd;
execution resolves it, so help/error paths do not need cwd discovery.
Reproduce with `python3 tests/capture_session_cli.py` and
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_session_cli.py`.
Evidence: `docs/evidence/baseline/session-cli.json` and
`docs/evidence/session-arguments-tests.txt`. Other commands and remaining CLI
combinations are unverified; valid resume execution remains unfinished.

Detached plain session text output now matches 71 official-release scenarios:
table columns, truncation and full-ID details, optional cells, multiple rows,
list/current filters, empty panels, long-token wrapping, widths 1 through 300,
and valid/invalid `PRODEX_TERM_COLUMNS` overrides. `COLUMNS` is ignored as in
the release. Tests compare raw bytes in identical disposable homes.
The initial slice covers printable ASCII; terminal dimensions and the
interactive view remain unimplemented. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/session-text-tests.txt`. The text mismatch reproducer now records
matching output separately from the remaining startup side-effect differences.

Plain rendering now measures display cells and preserves UTF-8 for supported
Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, CJK, kana and Hangul ranges, combining accents and soft
hyphens. The suite compares 239 raw-output scenarios, including Unicode range
edges, truncation, padding, full IDs and Unicode/paragraph path wrapping.
Other scripts, emoji sequences and remaining control cells still fail
explicitly. Evidence: `docs/evidence/session-unicode-tests.txt`.

Session inspection now decodes dictionary-free Zstandard rollouts in native
Mojo, including raw/RLE/compressed blocks, FSE/Huffman tables and reuse,
repeat offsets, checksums, concatenated/skippable frames and bounded streaming.
Independent vectors come from Python's test-only standard `compression.zstd`;
the production binary never calls it. Full command checks cover list/current,
filters and machine output, records crossing frames/blocks, decoded line-size
limits and 25 frozen-release diagnostic cases. Error/read ordering around
8192 decoded bytes is reproduced, including early rejection of non-session
metadata. Evidence: `docs/evidence/zstd-tests.txt` and
`docs/evidence/baseline/session-zstd-errors.json`.

One noncanonical Huffman input is accepted by the release despite unused
entropy bits prohibited by RFC 8878 section 4.2.2. Modex rejects it before the
release's subsequent UTF-8 error. The exact synthetic input and both observed
errors are retained as an unapproved difference. A second retained difference
is an empty frame declaring 134217729 decoded bytes: the release accepts it,
while Modex rejects the oversized window. No parity PASS is claimed.

The active release staging/smoke path imports the JavaScript gateway SDK.
Its module-import compatibility is BLOCKED by the Mojo-only/no-adapter policy,
not removed from scope. `docs/packaging-audit.json` preserves conflicting
source/publishing/README evidence.

TZif v1-v3 leap-second tables now participate in timezone transition lookup
without changing the POSIX seconds displayed in session timestamps. There are
324 official-release comparisons covering positive/negative/mixed corrections,
exact transition seconds, 64-bit times, file-mtime fallback, future rules,
invalid records, indicator pairs and inconsistent footers. Invalid files and
unsupported TZif v4 fall back to UTC as in the frozen reader. Native tests
also cover correction overflow. The fixtures are synthetic; this host has no
installed `right/` leap-zone directory. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/leap-timezone-tests.txt` and `tests/test_timezone_files.py`.

Next work: complete remaining Unicode display widths and the terminal view,
and evaluate official stdlib mechanisms for state loading and recovery.
Stateful paths still fail explicitly. Future recurring timezone rules and
POSIX TZ strings are implemented; their earlier evidence is
`docs/evidence/recurring-time-tests.txt`.
Startup effects still differ. Details and the baseline
panic are in `docs/known-gaps.md`; no session contract is PASS.

Mojo's public process API has no stdio-redirection, process-group, or
environment-isolation options. Its networking package currently exposes only
internal building blocks. The official stdlib source at the pinned release
must be checked before interpreting missing public APIs as impossible native
implementations. No dependency exception has been introduced.

Native Windows and Intel macOS are not supported by the pinned compiler's
documented platform contract. Linux glibc and CPU minimums are stricter than
the baseline release. These obligations remain in scope as platform gaps.
